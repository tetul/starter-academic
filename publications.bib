abstract = {Locomotion and mobility have been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster but less is known about the locomotor capacity of other Drosophila species, while the response to chronic exercise in other species has yet to be examined. We have shown that adult male D. melanogaster adapt to exercise training with improved running endurance, climbing speed, and flight ability compared to unexercised flies. Here, we examine baseline mobility of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. virilis, and their response to chronic exercise training. We found significant interspecific differences in mobility and in the response to exercise. Although there is a significant sex difference in exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, intraspecific analysis reveals few sex differences in other Drosophila species. As octopamine has been shown to be important for exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, we also asked if any observed differences could be attributed to baseline octopamine levels. We find that octopamine and tyramine levels have the same rank order as baseline climbing speed and endurance in males, but do not predict the response to chronic exercise in males or females. Future research should focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for the inter- and intraspecific differences in mobility and the response to exercise.},

abstract = {Endurance exercise is an effective therapeutic intervention with substantial pro-healthspan effects. Male Drosophila respond to a ramped daily program of exercise by inducing conserved physiological responses similar to those seen in mice and humans. Female flies respond to an exercise stimulus but do not experience the adaptive training response seen in males. Here, we use female flies as a model to demonstrate that differences in exercise response are mediated by differences in neuronal activity. The activity of octopaminergic neurons is specifically required to induce the conserved cellular and physiological changes seen following endurance training. Furthermore, either intermittent, scheduled activation of octopaminergic neurons or octopamine feeding is able to fully substitute for exercise, conferring a suite of pro-healthspan benefits to sedentary Drosophila. These experiments indicate that octopamine is a critical mediator of adaptation to endurance exercise in Drosophila. Chronic exercise causes stereotypical adaptations in muscle and adipose tissue of Drosophila. Sujkowski et al. show that these adaptations require the activity of octopaminergic neurons. Differences in octopaminergic activity control sexual dimorphism in exercise response. Both octopamine feeding and stimulation of octopaminergic neurons can substitute for endurance exercise.},

abstract = {We investigated the peptide inventory of the corpora cardiaca (CC) of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, by direct tissue profiling using MALDI-TOF MS combined with proteomic approaches focusing on cysteine-containing peptides. An agatoxin-like peptide (ALP) was identified as a component of the glandular part of the CC and was associated with the presence of the adipokinetic hormone in mass spectra. Although abundant in the CC, ALP does not belong to the toxins observed in the venom gland of A. mellifera. Homologs of ALP are highly conserved in major groups of arthropods and in line with this we detected ALP in the CC of non-venomous insects such as cockroaches and silverfish. In the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, ALP was also identified in the CNS and stomatogastric nervous system. This is the first report that establishes the presence of ALPs in the neuroendocrine tissues of insects and further studies are necessary to reveal common functions of these peptides, e.g. as antimicrobial agents, ion channel modulators or classical neuropeptides. Biological significance: Among the messenger molecules of the nervous system, neuropeptides represent the structurally most diverse class and basically participate in the regulation of all physiological processes. The set of neuropeptides, their functions and spatial distribution are particularly well-studied in insects. Until now, however, several potential neuropeptide receptors remained orphan, which indicates the existence of so far unknown ligands. In our study, we used proteomic methods such as cysteine modification, enzymatic digestion and peptide derivatization, combined with direct tissue profiling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, for the discovery of novel putative messenger molecules in the neuroendocrine system. The described presence of agatoxin-like peptides in the nervous system of the honey bee and other insects was overseen so far and is thus a remarkable addition to the very well studied neuropeptidome of insects. It is not yet clear, if these toxin-like peptides act as antimicrobial agents, ion channel modulators or classical neuropeptides.},

abstract = {Honey bee foragers show a strong diurnal rhythm of foraging activity, and such behavioral changes are likely under the control of specific neuromodulators. To identify and quantify neuromodulators involved in regulating rest and arousal in honey bees, we established a mass spectrometric method for quantifying 14 different neurochemicals and precursor molecules. We measured forager type and brain region specific differences in amine levels from individual honey bee brains and brain regions. The observed differences in amine levels between resting and aroused foragers resemble findings in other species indicating a conserved molecular mechanism by glutamate and GABA in regulating arousal. Subesophageal ganglion specific changes in the histaminergic system and global increases in aspartate during arousal suggest a possible role of histamine and aspartate in feeding and arousal, respectively. More aminergic systems were significantly affected due to arousal in nectar foragers than in pollen foragers, implying...},
