title: "Honey bee foraging and the histaminergic system"
summary: "This project stems from my PhD work where I found a correlation between honey bee foraging behavior and the ratios between histamine and its precursor, histidine. I explore this using pharmacological experiments in this project. By treating feeder trained bees with histamine, histidine, or the antagonist ranitidine, we look for changes in foraging activity."
